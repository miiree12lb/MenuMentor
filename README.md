# MenuMentor
## Introduction
This is a cross-platform desktop application created using Java. I developed this project predominantly during my 11th and 12th grades in high school. The application's primary functionality is to generate weekly menus based on user preferences. Users start by inputting the minimum amount of calories they wish to consume daily. They can then add ingredients and courses to their preferences.

When adding a new course, users specify whether it is a first or second course and whether they prefer it during lunch or dinner. Additionally, the application prompts users for the maximum number of times they want to include a particular course in their weekly menu and the minimum wait time before repeating it. The system utilizes this information to generate a personalized weekly menu. If any of the specified conditions are not met, the affected course will be highlighted in red on the weekly menu.

In addition to menu generation, the application compiles a list of all the required ingredients for the week, along with the necessary amounts. Users can print this list and save it on their computer. The application provides features such as modifying the proposed menu, obtaining caloric data for the week, generating a list of unmet requirements, and modifying all application data.
